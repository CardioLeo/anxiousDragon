// Description:
// Title: anxiousDragon

// This project, which I originally began either towards the end of 2020
// or the beginning of 2021, is rough around the edges, but I've tested it
// quite a lot, and worked out a number of the kinks.

// This project has 4 scripts, two which begin when the green flag is
// pressed, and two (one per sprite) which begin if you press on each
// sprite. There are three possible outcomes, found by answering the
// questions asked by the sprites or clicking on either of the two sprites.

// November 2022 is the day when I finally got around to making both
// scripts play out much closer to the way I wanted them to to begin with.
