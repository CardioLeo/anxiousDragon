// Notes and Credits:

// All the work was my own, except that I used a background,
// two sprites and graphics from Scratch's open library
// (although with a different colored cat).

---

// This project, which I originally began either towards the end of 2020
// or the beginning of 2021, is rough around the edges, but I've tested it
// quite a lot, and worked out a number of the kinks.

// This project has 4 scripts, two which begin when the green flag is
// pressed, and two (one per sprite) which begin if you press on each
// sprite. There are at least three possible outcomes, found by
// answering the questions asked by the sprites or clicking on either
// of the two sprites.

// First, the Absent-Minded Cat may escape before the Anxious Dragon
// can be reasured enough to catch him.

// Second, the Anxious Dragon may catch the Absent-Minded Cat before
// the cat can realize what's going on around him.

// Third, you may just discover a way to help the cat to narrowly escape.

// November 2022 is the day when I finally got around to making both
// scripts play out much closer to the way I wanted them to to begin with.
